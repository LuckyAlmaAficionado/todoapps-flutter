A "To-Do" or "Todo List" app is a type of application designed to assist users in managing tasks, work, or daily activities. The primary goal of these apps is to help users organize, track, and complete tasks that need to be done. "To-Do" apps are commonly used to reduce confusion and enhance productivity by providing a structured way to manage task lists.
